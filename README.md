### Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an intelligent agent (a pirate) to find the optimal path to treasure in a maze environment. This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning concepts to a pathfinding problem.

I was provided with starter code including:
- A TreasureMaze class representing the environment as a matrix
- A GameExperience class for storing episodes for experience replay
- Helper functions to visualize the maze and test the model
- The structure of the neural network model

My contribution was implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm in the `qtrain` function, which included:
- Implementing the exploration vs. exploitation strategy using epsilon
- Creating the training loop for the agent to learn from experience
- Building the logic for updating the Q-values based on rewards
- Implementing the experience replay mechanism
- Fine-tuning the learning process to achieve a 100% win rate

The implementation successfully trains the pirate agent to find optimal paths from any starting position to the treasure, demonstrating effective learning through reinforcement.

### Connecting to Computer Science

#### What computer scientists do and why it matters
Computer scientists solve complex problems by creating algorithms and systems that can process information efficiently. In this project, I applied reinforcement learning to teach an agent to navigate through a maze environment - demonstrating how computer scientists develop solutions that can learn from experience rather than being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

This matters because these techniques can be applied to countless real-world problems beyond games, including robotics navigation, resource optimization, financial modeling, and healthcare decision-making. The ability to create systems that improve through experience is transforming how we approach complex problems across all industries.

#### How I approach problems as a computer scientist
Working on this project reinforced my problem-solving approach:
1. Understanding the problem space (maze environment, possible actions, rewards)
2. Breaking down complex tasks into manageable components (exploration vs. exploitation, experience replay, Q-value updates)
3. Implementing solutions iteratively and testing frequently
4. Analyzing performance metrics to guide improvements (win rate, loss values)
5. Refining the solution until it meets the required criteria (100% win rate)

This methodical, data-driven approach is core to computer science, focusing on building systems that are not just functional but optimal and resilient.

#### Ethical responsibilities
While this project is a simulation, it highlights important ethical considerations that apply to real-world AI systems:

- **Transparency**: I ensured the learning process was visible and trackable through detailed epoch reporting, making it clear how the agent improves over time
- **Reliability**: The agent needed to achieve 100% success from any starting position, demonstrating reliability across different scenarios
- **Purpose-driven design**: The goal was clear (find treasure efficiently) with well-defined parameters for success

In professional applications, these ethical considerations become even more critical as AI systems make decisions that impact people's lives, resources, or safety. Computer scientists must design systems that are not only technically sound but also fair, transparent, and aligned with human values.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrated how reinforcement learning techniques can create intelligent agents capable of solving complex navigation problems. The skills developed here e.g implementing neural networks, designing reward systems, and balancing exploration versus exploitation, are foundational to many advanced applications in artificial intelligence and computer science more broadly.
